## 1\. Overview

In this quick tutorial, we’ll learn about the different types of bean scopes in the Spring framework.

The scope of a bean defines the life cycle and visibility of that bean in the contexts we use it.

The latest version of the Spring framework defines 6 types of scopes:

- singleton
- prototype
- request
- session
- application
- websocket
