### 3.7. NESTED Propagation

For *NESTED* propagation, Spring checks if a transaction exists, and if so, it marks a save point. This means that if our business logic execution throws an exception, then the transaction rollbacks to this save point. If there’s no active transaction, it works like *REQUIRED*.

***DataSourceTransactionManager* supports this propagation out-of-the-box. Some implementations of *JTATransactionManager* may also support this.**

**[*JpaTransactionManager*](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/JpaTransactionManager.html) supports *NESTED* only for JDBC connections. However, if we set the *nestedTransactionAllowed* flag to *true*, it also works for JDBC access code in JPA transactions if our JDBC driver supports save points.  
**

Finally, let’s set the *propagation* to *NESTED*:

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NESTED)
public void nestedExample(String user) { 
    // ... 
}
```
