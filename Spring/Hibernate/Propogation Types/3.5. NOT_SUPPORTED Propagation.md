### 3.5. NOT_SUPPORTED Propagation

If a current transaction exists, first Spring suspends it, and then the business logic is executed without a transaction:

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
public void notSupportedExample(String user) { 
    // ... 
}
```

**The *JTATransactionManager* supports real transaction suspension out-of-the-box. Others simulate the suspension by holding a reference to the existing one and then clearing it from the thread context**
