## 3\. Prototype Scope

A bean with the *prototype* Â scope will return a different instance every time it is requested from the container. It is defined by setting the value *prototype* to the *@Scope* annotation in the bean definition:

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public Person personPrototype() {
    return new Person();
}
```

We can also use a constant like we did for the *singleton* scope:

```java
@Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
```

We will now write a similar test as before that shows two objects requesting the same bean name with the *prototype* scope. They will have different states as they are no longer referring to the same bean instance:

```java
private static final String NAME = "John Smith";
private static final String NAME_OTHER = "Anna Jones";

@Test
public void givenPrototypeScope_whenSetNames_thenDifferentNames() {
    ApplicationContext applicationContext = 
      new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("scopes.xml");

    Person personPrototypeA = (Person) applicationContext.getBean("personPrototype");
    Person personPrototypeB = (Person) applicationContext.getBean("personPrototype");

    personPrototypeA.setName(NAME);
    personPrototypeB.setName(NAME_OTHER);

    Assert.assertEquals(NAME, personPrototypeA.getName());
    Assert.assertEquals(NAME_OTHER, personPrototypeB.getName());

    ((AbstractApplicationContext) applicationContext).close();
}
```

The *scopes.xml* file is similar to the one presented in the previous section while adding the xml definition for the bean with the *prototype* scope:

```xml
<bean id="personPrototype" class="org.baeldung.scopes.Person" scope="prototype"/>
```
